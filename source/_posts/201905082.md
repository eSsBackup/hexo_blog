## Description

Because of the slow connection speed inside the GFW, I try to find a way to increase the download speed through snap on Google

## Solution

Snap command uses snapd process to communicate with server. And the snapd process load setting in Systemctl config, which only work in this way on the linux distro with systemd init.
So in order to speed up the snap command, we should first use 'systemctl edit' command in terminal.

```bash
systemctl edit snapd
```

Add add the description below to config

```bash
[Service]
Environment="http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8118"
Environment="https_proxy=127.0.0.1:8118"
```

Suppose the http proxy server (like privoxy) is listening on port 8118

After editing the systemctl service config, you should reload systemd and restart snapd by commands below.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart snapd
```
