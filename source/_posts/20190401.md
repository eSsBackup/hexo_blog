## Description

When I tried to install adobe source code pro from system fonts manager (Whatever it's called on macOS), Emacs 26 on macOS couldn't found it and popped out a error.

## Solution

After googled it, I found a comment on github, saying that it can be fixed by installing source code pro through homebrew.

```bash
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-source-code-pro --fontdir=/Library/Fonts
```

It works well
